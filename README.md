# CS5500 Final Project: SpamFree Bot in Discord

## About
The SpamFree bot allows discord server owners to verify their members upon joining the server by solving challenges, such as CAPTCHA challenges. Adding the SpamFree bot will help prevent unauthroized users and spam bots from entering the server, providing members a more secure environment.

## Getting Stated
You can join our [test server]() where the bot is added to test the functionalities of the bot. You can also add the bot to your own server by following the instructions below.

### How to Install and Run the Bot
- Discord developer
- Bot token

#### Fly.io link

#### How to add to your server
